### About Me
I grew up in central Wisconsin **GO PACK** and moved to Utah about 4 1/2 years ago. I'm currently a software engineer at Biofire Diagnostics, writing software for the flagship FilmArray 2.0 and Torch systems. I love modal text editing, skiing, cycling, and learning new things.

### Why do I have a work history as a Lab Scientist?
After earning my Bachelor's Degree in Biotechnology, I committed 11 months to getting certified by the ASCP as a Medical Laboratory Scientist. I worked in clinical laboratories for the past 4 years, where my attention to detail and calmness in a stressful evironment made me a great team member. About 2 years ago I found myself hitting a "knowledge ceiling" in my field, so with nothing new to satisfy my keeness for learning I turned to my other interest, Computer Science. 

After completing my degree in Software Development, I put my knowledge of laboratory system software to use at my current job at BioFire Diagnostics. I hope to apply the unique skills I have developed in the medical laboratory field to the challenges that await on your development team.
