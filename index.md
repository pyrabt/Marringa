### About Me
I grew up in central Wisconsin **GO PACK** and moved to Utah about 3 1/2 years ago. I'm currently in my final semester of my [Master's Degree in Software Development](https://msd.utah.edu/) at the University of Utah. I enjoy writing lower level programs in C++/C and most recently Rust. I love modal text editing, learning new things, skiing, and cycling.

### Why do you have a work history as a Lab Scientist?
After earning my Bachelor's Degree in Biotechnology, I committed 11 months to getting certified by the ASCP as a Medical Laboratory Scientist. I worked in clinical laboratories for the past 4 years, where my attention to detail and calmness in a stressful evironment made me a great team member. About 2 years ago I found myself hitting a "knowledge ceiling" in my field, so with nothing new to satisfy my keeness for learning I turned to my other interest, Computer Science. With a constant cycle of new releases, and interesting things to master I found developing my own projects to be really satisfying. That inspired to me to apply for my current program where I have continued to master new skills and create interesting things.
